# Churn-using-ANN
Predicting churn of a telecom company using an Artificial Neural Net.

# Data
The dataset used to build the Artificial Neural Network is taken from the online data science portal Kaggle. The dataset consists of roughly 3500 rows and 21 columns. Each row corresponds to a single entry mentioning the details of a single customer and whether that particular customer stayed with the company. The last column of the dataset ‘churn’ describes this. If ‘churn=True’ for a particular customer, then the customer discontinued the telecom services. Whereas if ‘churn=False’, then the customer continues the telecom services.

# Objectives
To predict and rank the customers most likely to discontinue the telecom services. Doing this will enable the organization to focus on these customers and develop methods to retain them.
To provide valuable insight into which factors impact the churning decision of the customer the most. Using this, the organization can  focus on the development of these factors and withdraw its resources from the development of non essential factors.
